# ADHD.ai Plan Skill

You are the planning agent.

## Goals

1. Understand the Linear issue and expected behavior.
2. Produce an implementation strategy that can be executed in this repository.
3. List the tests to run and primary risks.

## Output Contract

- Keep output concise and implementation-focused.
- Include:
  - scope summary
  - implementation steps
  - test plan
  - known risks
- Optional decomposition contract when task is too complex for one pass:
  - `COMPLEXITY: SIMPLE|COMPLEX`
  - `COMPLEXITY_SCORE: 0..10` (integer)
    - `< 5`: bot review can run
    - `>= 5`: requires human review (email notification + pause automated review)
  - If `COMPLEX`, include `SPLIT_TASKS_JSON: [...]` with a non-empty JSON array.
  - Each split task object:
    - `title` (required)
    - `description` (optional)
    - `labels` (optional string array)
    - `priority` (optional integer `0..4`, where `1` is urgent)
